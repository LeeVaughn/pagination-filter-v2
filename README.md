# Pagination Filter

The project uses pagination and filters to improve the user experience for a website containing a list of students.

## Motivation

This is a rebuild of the second project in Treehouse's Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree program. I originally created the
project using jQuery but I decided to recreate it using vanilla JavaScript.

## Features

* 10 students are displayed per page
* Pagination links at the bottom allow the user to move through the student list
* JavaScript is unobtrusive
* User can search for specific students by using the search bar
* If a search returns 0 results a message is displayed informing the user that no results have been found
